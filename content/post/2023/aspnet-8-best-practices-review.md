My friend and coworker, [Jonathan Danylko](https://www.danylkoweb.com), spent a lot of this year working hard on his first technical book. JD's a prolific blogger and loves sharing his knowledge, so I know he's been excited to get this book finished and into the world.

I think it's a great book - it's a densely packed treasure trove of suggestions and best practices that will be invaluable for people who are just starting their careers, and even experienced developers will probably learn something from it. I've been in the software industry over 25 years, I've worked with .NET since 1.1 came out in 2003, and I still picked up a lot of useful tips from JD's book... for me, the sections on middleware were particularly useful, since I haven't worked with it too frequently in my career.

If you're just starting out, it will help to get you on the right path and avoid some of the common pitfalls that I wish I'd known about before falling into them. His explanations for why he suggests doing things a certain way are concise and easy to understand.

If you're a beginner or intermediate ASP.NET developer, I wholeheartedly recommend this book and I think you'll learn a lot from it. Even if you're an experienced developer, I think you'll find it worth the read and you'll learn something from it... and of course, that's what we're all here for as developers, right?

If this sounds interesting, [you can pick up a Kindle or paperback copy](https://www.amazon.com/ASP-NET-Best-Practices-techniques-large-scale/dp/183763212X?crid=2XQDOXG67B5EW&keywords=asp.net+8+best+practices&qid=1703883385&sprefix=asp.net+8+best%2Caps%2C144&sr=8-1) from Amazon or find it wherever your favorite Packt books are available.
