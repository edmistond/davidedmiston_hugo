Title: "Some Blog Automation Notes"
date: 2023-10-06

I've _finally_ gotten around to something I should have done a long time ago; I've moved the blog repository [over to GitHub](https://github.com/edmistond/davidedmiston_hugo), and since it's a public repository I _finally_ set up GitHub Actions... so beyond testing posts locally, getting a new post up now is as simple as merging a new PR into main. Heck, I could even type up a new post on my phone, assuming I hated myself that much.

... it may be that I'm just posting this note so I can confirm that the system works.
